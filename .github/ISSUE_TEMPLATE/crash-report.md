**Context**
What were you doing when the game crashed? Add images, screenshots, or videos if they could be useful.

**Crash Report**,
We need the crash report to figure out why the crash happened. This file can be found in the "crash-reports" folder of your Minecraft folder. It will be the newest file there. Please upload the file to https://mclo.gs/ and put the link here. Do not paste the contents of the file here, because that will make this issue very hard to read.
